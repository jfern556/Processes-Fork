# Processes-Fork
This program will accept a number if integer numbers. It  will then request a shared memory for the integers entered, attach the memory  to its own address space and fill this space with the numbers. After this it   will create child processes according to the number of inputs,each child   process with an unique id. Each number of the shared memory is stored in an   array, and corresponds to one of the childs depending on the element number   and child Id. For example, element 1 on the array with index 0 corresponds to  child 1. Each of one of these elements will be multiplied for the correspon-  ding child ID and stored back in the array. Parent has to wait for each child   process to finish and then display the final shared memory, detach it and   remove it.
